SurveyEditor allows you to add new survey questions directly into the FeverFinder Survey application! To add a new question go to File > New Question, fill in the form and hit 'Add Question'. Repeat this to add as many questions as necessary. At any point you can view the current question additions and current choice option additions. To do this go to View > Question Additions/Choice Additions respectively. Once all additions have been made, go to File > Save to save all changes and update the FeverFinder Survey application.
